A basic calculator webapp made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). 

To view the calculator go to: [`calc.randysemicolon.dev`](https://calc.randysemicolon.dev).

There are still some things I have to work on.

Things like:
- solving the infinite screen expension.
- themes
- Adding a "complexity button", to add powers, quadrants and roots.
- refactoring the code base.

But this is a decent-ish mvp.
